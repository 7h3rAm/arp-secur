# TODO for arp-safe v0.3
# 2011-04-09

1. Process broadcast ARP REQUEST packet from A > B (where we are C).
	Broadcast received by our system and arp-safe application
	arp-safe ignores it because the arp request is for B
	Will this broadcast request for B create an arp cache entry on C?
	If yes, then we need to consider it as well for our spoof-detection logic

2. Sanitize!!!
